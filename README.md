# dataMiningUsingR-Feature_CrossVal_ShrinkageMethods

The files HW4Data.csv and HW4Data Test.csv contain data on two variables, X and Y. The dependent variable Y is a function of X. On this dataset, we use cross-validation, feature selection, and shrinkage methods. 

Methods used:
1. Leave one out Cross Validation (LOOCV).
2. LOOCV using randome seeds
3. Feature Selection
4. Forward and Backward stepwise feature selection
5. Lasso Model
6. Comparision of previous models
